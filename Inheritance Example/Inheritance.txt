Inheritance in Java:
	The process of a child class inheriting the properties associated with the parent class.
	A class can inherit off of a singular superclass by using the extends keyword.

Advantages:
	- related classes using the same fields do not have to waste space with repeated code
	- organizes code by shortening similar class properties
 
Disadvantages:
	- requires heavy documentation to be useful
	- class must be designed for inheritance
	- composition is preferred over inheritance
	- can only have one super class (no hybrid inheritance)
