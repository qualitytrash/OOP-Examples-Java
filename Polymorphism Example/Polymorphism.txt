Polymorphism in Java:
	The ability for an object to take on many different forms, most commonly through the use of polymorphism through superclass references
	to a subclass object. 
	Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic, and the only possible way to access an object
	is through a reference variable, which can only be of one type.

Advantages:
	- method overloading allows methods with similar functions to be accessed through one method name
	- can be implemented to constructors to initialize objects in class differently
	- allows subclasses to use all definitions from the superclass
 
Disadvantages:
	- developers find it difficult to implement into code
	- performance issues during run time due to machine needing to decide which method to run
	- reduces readability of the program
