Encapsulation in Java:
	The mechanism of hiding variables of a class from other classes, only allowing for these variables to be accessed through the methods of the
	current class. Also known as data hiding.
	Encapsulation can be done by declaring the variables of the class as private, and then providing setter and getter methods in order to
	change and access these variables from another associated class.

Advantages:
	- hides data from other classes 
	- organizes functions of classes and their distinct roles
	- prevents data from being accessed by outside code
 
Disadvantages:
	- inefficiency created through extra indirection
	- computer does not enforce it
